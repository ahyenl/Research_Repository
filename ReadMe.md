[ex1-7-n-nn-nnn.py](ex1-6-time-converter.py)
- This Python code is a simple calculator that takes an input digit 'n' from the user, calculates 'nn' (n repeated twice) and 'nnn' (n repeated three times), and then computes their sum. 

[ex2-1-pos-neg.py](ex1-6-time-converter.py)
- This Python code takes an input numeric value from the user and then checks whether it is zero, positive, or negative. 

[ex2-2-disc-calc.py](ex2-2-disc-calc.py)
- This Python code is a program that calculates and applies a discount based on the total sum of money spent by a customer. It prompts the user to enter the total sum, checks the sum against certain conditions, and calculates the discount accordingly. 

[ex2-3-inspirator.py](ex2-3-inspirator.py)
- This Python code is a simple program that takes an input programming language from the user and provides a career suggestion based on the language entered. It uses the new "match" statement to implement the logic. 

[ex2-4-grad-calc.py](ex2-4-grad-calc.py)
- This Python code is a simple program that takes an input exam mark from the user, and based on that mark, it assigns a grade and prints it in a specific text color using ANSI escape codes.

[ex3-1-mult-tables.py](ex3-1-mult-tables.py)
- This Python code is a program that generates and prints a multiplication table for a given whole number entered by the user. 

[ex3-2-pyramid.py](ex3-2-pyramid.py)
- This Python code consists of two parts, each of which uses nested loops to print a pattern of asterisks, one increasing and the other decreasing.


[ex3-3-bingo-card.py](ex3-3-bingo-card.py)
- This Python code generates and prints a bingo-like grid of random numbers using the random module.

[ex3-4-guess-number.py](ex3-4-guess-number.py)
- This Python code is a simple number guessing game. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 20, and the player's goal is to guess that number within as few attempts as possible. The code uses ANSI escape codes to change text colors for a more visually appealing user interface. This code creates a simple interactive number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a random number within a specified range, receiving feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.


[ex4-1-input-list.py](ex4-1-input-list.py)
- This Python code creates a program that collects input from the user and stores it in a list. 

[ex4-2-random-colours.py](ex4-2-random-colours.py)
